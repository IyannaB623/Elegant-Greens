A restaurant layout using HTML and CSS. What is different about this project is that it is using floats not flex.

	:x: NO FLEX ZONE
  :white_check_mark: ALL FLOATS
  
  This project was great practice using floats although float is not as common as flex. In the instance a project needs to be converted from float to flex etc. this demonstrates that capability.
